This is the code acompanying the paper: 

- B. Wu and M.H. Cho. "Robust fast direct integral equation solver for three-dimensional quasi-periodic scattering problems with a large number of layers." *Journal of Computational Physics* 495 (2023): 112573

The code contains examples for solving quasi-periodic scattering problems in 3-D multilayered media.

- run `DEMO_quasiperi_scattering_2layers.m` for an example of wave transmission through a media with two layers
- run `DEMO_quasiperi_scattering_4layers.m` for an example of wave transmission through a media with multiple layers (default 4 layers)
