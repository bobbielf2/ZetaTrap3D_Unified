This folder contains example codes for solving quasi-periodic scattering problems in 3-D multilayered media.

- run `DEMO_quasiperi_scattering_2layers.m` for an example of wave transmission through a media with two layers
- run `DEMO_quasiperi_scattering_4layers.m` for an example of wave transmission through a media with multiple layers (default 4 layers)

The numerical method is summarized in the paper:
